\section{Introduction}

We consider a derangement of size $N$ to be an array $D$ that is a permutation of ${0, â€¦, N - 1}$
where no element is in its correct sorted position.
That is, for all $i, 0 <= i < N, D[i] \neq i$. Note that in our definition of derangement,
all elements are distinct.

% \paragraph{Outline}
% The remainder of this article is organized as follows.
% Section~\ref{previous work} gives account of previous work.
% Our new and exciting results are described in Section~\ref{results}.
% Finally, Section~\ref{conclusions} gives the conclusions.

A good swap in a derangement $D$ of size $N$ is a pair $(i, j), 0 <= i < j < N$
such that $D[i] = j$ or $D[j] = i$.
% In English, a swap is good if it places at least one element in its correct sorted position.

Let s be the number of good swaps in a derangement D of size N.
First observe that for every element $x$ in $D$, there is at most one good swap that places $x$ in its
correct position, so $s <= N$. Also, $s > \lfloor N / 2 \rfloor$, this follows from the fact that a good swap,
 in the best case, places two elements in their correct positions (i.e $D[i] = j$ AND $D[j] = i$).

So we know that $ \lfloor N/2 \rfloor < s <= N$. using these bounds, we can show that the expected number of random
swaps to sort D is between $N^2/8$ and $N^2/2$. To get a more exact running time, it could be
helpful to find the expected number of good swaps. This is defined as

\[ E[s] = \sum_{k = \lfloor N/2 \rfloor}^{N} p_k \times k \]

Where $p_k$ is the probability of a derangement having $k$ good swaps. We can define this as

\[ \frac{\text{number of derangements with $k$ good swaps}}{\text{total number of derangements}} \]

It can be shown that the number of derangements of size N is exactly $\lfloor \frac{N! + 1}{e} \rfloor$.
But how many derangements of size $N$ have $K$ good swaps?


\section{Model as Graph}
Given a derangement $D$ of size $N$ we construct a directed graph $G(V, E)$ where $V = \{0, ..., N - 1\}$
and $(i, j) \in E$ if $D[i] = j$. First observe that there are no self-loops in this graph because in 
a derangement there is no element in its correct position. Secondly, observe that each vertex $i$ has an outdegree
of exactly $1$, that is, $D[i] = j$ for some $j$ and if $D[i] = j$ and $D[i] = k$ then $j = k$. A similar argument shows that each
vertex has an indegree of $1$. With these observations, the graph must be a connected cycle graph, or if
disconnected, decomposed into multiple cycle graphs each with 2 or more nodes.
Let's call a graph with these properties a \textbf{derangement graph}.
The number of good swaps in $D$ is almost the number of edges in its derangement graph, except if we have a cycle of $2$ nodes,
that represents $1$ good swap, whereas if we have a cycle of $m$ nodes where $m > 2$ then that cycle contributes
$m$ good swaps ($m$ nodes implies $m$ edges, each being an instance where $D[i] = j$ so one of $(i, j)$ or 
$(j, i)$ is a good swap).

We then rephrase our original problem to the following: how many ways can we make a graph with
vertices $\{0, ..., N - 1\}$ such that it is a derangement graph with $k$ good swaps?

\section{Naive Recurrence}
Let T(N, k) be the number of derangement graphs with vertices $\{0, ..., N - 1\}$ with $k$ good swaps where
$k <= N$.
We define a recurrence for T(N, K). It is based on the following idea:

Pick $i$ vertices from the $N$ vertices. With these $i$ vertices, we will make a cycle of length $i$.

If $i = 2$, this cycle contributes $1$ good swap. So 



\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}
We worked hard, and achieved very little.
